# Blood Moon
Small bash game made for a class project/challenge.

This was made around late 2018 - early 2019. It was my first time programming, so there are many things that could be improved; coding, structure, order, etc... I ended up having to rush at the end of the project and had to cutout some content and features, as the project was too ambitious for the limited time available.

I don't plan to update or translate this, however I'm working on a similar project made in python

The gamed featured SFX but I can't include them due to licensing.
